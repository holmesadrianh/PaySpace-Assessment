## Part 1
Simple responsive webpage.

This section was kept simple. No custom CSS was used as the Bootstrap framework and utility classes is sufficient to create a simple layout. For more specific and unique designs, this would require more time or designer input. Keeping it clean and simple is more reliable if there is no design input.


## Part 2
Using the existing foundation, a simple page for listing and filtering books was implemented. The focus is mainly on the filtering functionality. Design kept minimal and default with bootstrap to save time.


## Part 3
Re-implemented part 2 into VueJS. The data for the books was also migrated to a json file and reusable sections were converted to components.
